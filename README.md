"In this chapter, we'll be diving into a totally different paradigm of writing software called "object-oriented programming". 

This differs from the previous style we have been using, which is a more function-based approach that emphasizes orchestrating functions together as a series of actions like you did in Day Trip Generator. Now, we'll be writing programs where objects that we create interact with each other to create the flow of our applications.

There are many styles of programming out there, but OOP is a popular one and one that we will use quite a bit throughout the course!"
